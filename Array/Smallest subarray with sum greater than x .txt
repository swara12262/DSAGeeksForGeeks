Easy Accuracy: 47.73% Submissions: 17952 Points: 2
Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.

Examples:
A[] = {1, 4, 45, 6, 0, 19}
   x  =  51
Output: 3
Minimum length subarray is {4, 45, 6}

A[] = {1, 10, 5, 2, 7}
   x  = 9
Output: 1
Minimum length subarray is {10}

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers N and x. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required ouput.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N,x<=1000
1<=A[]<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
6 51
1 4 45 6 0 19
5 9
1 10 5 2 7
Output:
3
1
