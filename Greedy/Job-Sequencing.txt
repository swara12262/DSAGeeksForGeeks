Job Sequencing Problem 
Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated to it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. The task is to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consist of an integer N in first line denoting the number of jobs and the next line consist of Job id, Deadline and the Profit associated to that Job.

Output:
Output the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Your Task : Complete the function jobscheduling() that returns count of jobs and maximum profit.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Deadline <= 100
1 <= Profit <= 500

Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N)

Example:
Input:
2
4
1 4 20 2 1 10 3 1 40 4 1 30
5
1 2 100 2 1 19 3 2 27 4 1 25 5 1 15

Output:
2 60
2 127

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 2 jobs can be done with maximum profit of 60 (20+40).
Testcase 2: 2 jobs can be done with maximum profit of 127 (100+27).
