Easy Accuracy: 40.5% Submissions: 2797 Points: 2
Given an array arr of N positive integers, the task is to find the maximum sum increasing subsequence of the given array.

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, arr[] = {1, 101, 2, 3, 100} 
Output: 106
Explanation:The maximum sum of a
increasing sequence is obtained from
{1, 2, 3, 100}
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 6
Explanation:The maximum sum of a
increasing sequence is obtained from
{1, 2, 3}
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maxSumIS() which takes N and array arr as input parameters and returns the maximum value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
