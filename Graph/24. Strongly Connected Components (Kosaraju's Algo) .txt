Medium Accuracy: 49.73% Submissions: 15563 Points: 4
Given a graph with N nodes and M directed edges. Your task is to complete the function kosaraju() which returns an integer denoting the number of strongly connected components in the graph.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers N and M. In the next line there are M space-separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v.

Output:
For each test case in a new line output will an integer denoting the no of strongly connected components present in the graph.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kosaraju() which takes the number of vertices V and adjacency list of the graph as inputs and returns an integer denoting the number of strongly connected components in the given graph.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N + M).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 5000
0 <= M <= (N*(N-1))
0 <= u, v <= N-1
Sum of M over all testcases will not exceed 25*106

Example:
Input:
2
5 5
1 0 0 2 2 1 0 3 3 4
3 3
0 1 1 2 2 0

Output:
3
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1:
There is a connected subgraph that includes 0-1-2 which satisfy the condition of strongly connecting components i.e each node is reachable from every other nodes.

Another subgraph includes individual nodes 4 and 3. That gives us a total of 3 subgraphs satisfying the condition of strongly connected components.
