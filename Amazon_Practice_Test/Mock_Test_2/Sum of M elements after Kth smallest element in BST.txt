Problems
Given a Binary Search Tree (with all values unique) and two integers M and K. The task is to find the sum of M elements after Kth smallest element in BST.

Input:
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case, there will be two lines of input. The first line is a string representing the tree as described below:

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denote node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:

For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

The second line of input contains two space-separated integer values M and K.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, the sum of M elements after Kth smallest element in BST gets printed.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumOfNElemsAfterKthSmallest() which takes the root node of the BST and two integer values M and K as inputs. The function returns the sum of M elements after Kth smallest element in BST.

Expected Time Complexity: O(M + K).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(M + K).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 104
0 <= M + K <= N

Example:
Input:
2
5 4 6 3 N N 7 N N N 8
2 1
2 1 3
1 2
Output:
9
3

Explanation:
Testcase1: The BST in the above test case will look like
              5
          /        \ 
        4          6
     /     \     /      \
   3      N  N       7
 /    \                 /    \ 
N   N              N     8
Here, After 1st smallest element 3, sum of next 2 elements is 9, i.e., 5 + 4 = 9
Testcase 2: For the given above test case the BST will be
                    2
                  /    \
                1      3
Here, After 2nd smallest element 2, the sum of the next 1 element is 3.
