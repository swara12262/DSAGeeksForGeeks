Problems
Given a sorted array of distinct integers of size N which is rotated X number of times, the task is to find the value of X.
Note: Array is sorted in increasing order

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, size of the array. The second line of each test case contains N space-separated values of the array arr[].

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, the value of X gets printed.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function NumberOfRotations() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array (N) as inputs and returns values of X.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105

Example:
Input:
3
3
1 2 3
5
5 1 2 3 4
4
3 4 1 2

Output:
0
1
2

Explanation:
Testcase1: The array is not rotated hence answer is 0.
Testcase 2: Sorted array will look like {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and rotated once.
Testcase 3: Sorted array will look like {1, 2, 3, 4}, and it has been rotated 2 times.
