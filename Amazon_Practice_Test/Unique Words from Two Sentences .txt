Problems
Given two sentences A and B of lower case English letters, the task is to find all unique words.
A word is unique if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences and does not appear in the other sentence. You need to return a list of all unique words in lexicographical order.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains sentence A and the second line contains sentence B.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, all unique words in lexicographical order get printed.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function unique​Words() which takes the two strings A and B and returns a list of lixicographically sorted unique words.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N + M)
Expected Time Complexity: O(Nlog(N) + Mlog(M))

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N, M ≤ 103

Example:
Input:
2
I have a blue pen
I got a red pen
geeks for geeks
gfg is known for its content

Output:
blue got have red
content gfg is its known

Explanation:
Testcase 1: unique words are "have", "blue", "got", "red", return them in lexicographical order.
Testcase 2: unique words are "gfg", "is", "known", "its" "content", return them in lexicographical order.
