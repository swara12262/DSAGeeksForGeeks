Problems
There are m stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).
Note: The stair count starts from 0.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the total number of test cases. In each test cases, an integer m will be given.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print number of possible ways to reach mth stair. Answer your output % 109+7. That is mod it by 109+7.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You need to complete the function countWays that takes m as argument and returns the number of ways you can reach the top.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= m <= 105

Example:
Input:
3
4
10
24
Output:
5
89
75025
Explanation:
Testcase 1: You have the following stairs: 0 1 2 3 4.
The 0th stair can be reached in 1 way.
The 1st stair can be reached in 1 way.
The 2nd stair can be reached in 2 ways.
The 3rd stair can be reached in 3 ways.
The 4th stair can be reached in 5 ways.
Testcase 2: The 10th stair can be reached in 89 number of ways.
Testcase 3: The 24th stair can be reached in 75025 number of ways.
